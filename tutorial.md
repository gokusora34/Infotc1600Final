# The five required tags 
## DOCTYPE Tag
The first thing every HTML document needs is a **DOCTYPE** tag. \

This tag should be the first line of code inserted into any HTML document. \

## HTML Tag
The second tag that every HTML document needs is the **<html></html>** tags. This tag is what the entire HTML document sits inside, and should come right after the DOCTYPE, and should end the document with the </html> tag. \

## Head Tag
The third required tag is the **<head></head>** tag. The head tag has all the information about the html document that won't appear on the page, and is also used for the meta tags. \
